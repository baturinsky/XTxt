#XTxt - AS3 new text engine made easy

XTxt is a lightweight lib that allows using Flex4 text engine about as easy as possible.
Supports inline images, links, multiple native and embedded fonts and text styles.
See example to get an idea.

As a little extra, there is a simple (but fancy) Scrollbox class that can be used with or without XTxt.
